# CHARACTER IDEAS - non-final names are marked with (?)

??? (?):
* A relatively small girl with a big cloak and a cowboy hat who has mastered combat with her signature revolver.
* Might show up a couple times to save your bacon, telling you to sharpen up and watch your back.
* Might be seen doing some sort of agile movements across parts of the backgrounds of stages.
* Boss fight eventually? Maybe she's testing you, like Meta Knight.
* Hardened expression, unless she's been knocked back or otherwise caught off guard, which would be difficult to do.

# WEAPON IDEAS - non-final names are marked with (?)

Scrap Cannon:
* Has a small press in it, visible from the outside through a transparent area
* Acts kind of like 8BDM Dust Crusher but maybe a bit cooler (projectile that splits into smaller ones on impact)
* Alt-fire just fires small chunks of the stored trash
* Scrap is collected from robot enemies and spent ammo

??? (?):
* Forward air dash like Pile Driver (direction you're aiming)
* Stops everything for a couple frames (hitstop) then, unlike Pile Driver, knocks enemy back on impact to then potentially hit other enemies in the trajectory you push them in
